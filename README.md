# CJs Plugin
 My test plugin where I develop and learn.
 
 The current plugin says "Thanks for enabling my plugin!" upon activation.
 
 You can also use it to add a Main Menu or SubMenu called "CJs Options" that leads to an Admin Page for the Plugin
 
 Added a basic shortcode [cjs] that produces the output "My shortcode works!"
